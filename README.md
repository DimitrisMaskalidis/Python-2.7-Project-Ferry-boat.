# Python-2.7-Project-Ferry-boat

A ferry has a max carry weight 5000 tons. In the ferry are entering trunks
and cars. The fee for the trucks is 100$ and for the cars 70$.

Create a program that:

   A1. its gonna read the weight of the vehicle and if it doesnt overcome
       the total weight of the ship it enters it. After entering it will
       read what vehicle it is T for Trucks and C for Cars with a check that
       makes sure it is a T or a C and not something else. if the vehicle cant
       enter the program stops with a message "IMPORT OF VEHICLES IS OVER".
   
   A2. print the fee that every vehicle has to pay.
   
   A3. print what type of vehicle has entered most times.
  
   A4. print the lightest vehicle that has entered.

   A5. print the total income of the ferry
